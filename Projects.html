            <h2>GeneSynth</h2>
            <p>An interactive web application designed to explore and visualize the fascinating world of genetics, making complex concepts accessible to students and educators.</p>
            <h3>Inspiration</h3>
            <p>My inspiration for GeneSynth stemmed from the growing interest in genetics and biotechnology among students and educators. I wanted to create an engaging platform that simplifies complex genetic concepts, making them accessible and interactive. By combining visual tools with educational resources, I aimed to foster a deeper understanding of how genes influence traits and health.</p>
            <h3>What it does</h3>
            <p>GeneSynth allows users to visualize DNA sequences, experiment with mutations, analyze protein impacts, and search a comprehensive trait database. Each feature is crafted to enhance learning and provide insights into genetic variations, inheritance patterns, and the biological implications of mutations.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed a user-friendly platform using React and JavaScript to simplify genetic concepts through visual tools and educational resources.</li>
                <li>Implemented features for DNA sequence visualization, mutation experimentation, and protein impact analysis.</li>
                <li>Created a comprehensive trait database to enhance understanding of genetic variations and inheritance patterns.</li>
                <li>Integrated interactive elements to foster deeper engagement with biological implications of mutations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>BinGenius</h2>
            <p>An automated, smart waste management system that tracks waste levels and incentivizes responsible disposal behavior. Winner of the hackUNT 2024 robotics track.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed an intelligent, sensor-driven waste monitoring model using an ultrasonic sensor and ESP32 microcontroller.</li>
                <li>Created a Django-based backend to aggregate data across multiple bins and provide real-time insights.</li>
                <li>Implemented a rewards program to motivate consistent and responsible waste disposal among residents.</li>
                <li>Designed dual interfaces: one for residents to track community waste efforts and redeem rewards, and another for waste management teams to visualize bin fill levels.</li>
            </ul>
